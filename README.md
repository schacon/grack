Grack - Ruby/Rack Git Smart-HTTP Server Handler
===============================================

This project aims to replace the builtin git-http-backend CGI handler
distributed with C Git with a Rack application.  This reason for doing this
is to allow far more webservers to be able to handle Git smart http requests.

The default git-http-backend only runs as a CGI script, and specifically is
only targeted for Apache 2.x usage (it requires PATH_INFO to be set and 
specifically formatted).  So, instead of trying to get it to work with
other CGI capable webservers (Lighttpd, etc), we can get it running on nearly
every major and minor webserver out there by making it Rack capable.  Rack 
applications can run with the following handlers:

* CGI
* FCGI
* Mongrel (and EventedMongrel and SwiftipliedMongrel)
* WEBrick
* SCGI
* LiteSpeed
* Thin

These web servers include Rack handlers in their distributions:

* Ebb
* Fuzed
* Phusion Passenger (which is mod_rack for Apache and for nginx)
* Unicorn

With [Warbler](http://caldersphere.rubyforge.org/warbler/classes/Warbler.html),
and JRuby, we can also generate a WAR file that can be deployed in any Java
web application server (Tomcat, Glassfish, Websphere, JBoss, etc).

Since the git-http-backend is really just a simple wrapper for the upload-pack
and receive-pack processes with the '--stateless-rpc' option, it does not 
actually re-implement very much.

Configuration key `git_auto_init` may provide you ability to
auto init bare repository on-demand. Also configuration with key
`git_post_init` you may write your own way to post-initialization, for example
to install custom hooks etc. Example **post_init** code:

	class PostInit
		def init_repo(path, repo)
		  Dir.chdir(path) do
		    # add hook
		    puts "Trying to install hook..."
		  end
		end
	end


Dependencies
========================
* Ruby - http://www.ruby-lang.org
* Rack - http://rack.rubyforge.org
* A Rack-compatible web server
* Git >= 1.7 (currently the 'pu' branch)
* Mocha (only for running the tests)

Quick Start
========================
	$ gem install rack
	$ (edit config.ru to set git project path)
	$ rackup --host 127.0.0.1 -p 8080 config.ru
	$ git clone http://127.0.0.1:8080/schacon/grit.git 

Contributing
========================
If you would like to contribute to the Grack project, I prefer to get
pull-requests via GitHub.  You should include tests for whatever functionality
you add.  Just fork this project, push your changes to your fork and click
the 'pull request' button.  To run the tests, you first need to install the 
'mocha' mocking library and initialize the submodule.

	$ sudo gem install mocha
	$ git submodule init
	$ git submodule update

Then you should be able to run the tests with a 'rake' command.  You can also
run coverage tests with 'rake rcov' if you have rcov installed.
